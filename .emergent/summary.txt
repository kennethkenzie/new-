The previous AI engineer successfully built a Next.js, React, FastAPI, and MongoDB hotel website from an MVP. Initial work focused on enhancing the chatbot with OpenAI's gpt-4o-mini, multi-language support, and conversation memory, creating new API routes and a frontend component. Subsequently, numerous missing website pages (accommodation, booking, events, gallery, news, press, awards, travel agents) were created and thoroughly integrated into the navigation, with booking functionality linked. The chatbot was also made mobile-responsive. A major effort involved implementing a comprehensive admin dashboard, resolving critical issues like incorrect React Feather icon imports, persistent JSON parsing errors, missing React state, and temporary server 502 errors. Most recently, database integration for the dashboard was initiated, involving new MongoDB models and API updates. A hydration error in the facility section was also fixed. The current task is debugging an Internal Server Error during admin login after database setup.

The user's goal is to evolve the La Brezi Suites hotel MVP into a feature-rich application. This entails:
1.  **AI Chatbot Enhancement**: Integrate AI (GPT-4o-mini), multi-language support (English, Spanish, French), conversation memory, and full booking flow.
2.  **Website Content & Functionality Expansion**: Create core pages like , , , , ,  (with dynamic articles), , , , and . Ensure all booking buttons link to a central system and correct navigation.
3.  **Admin Dashboard**: Develop a comprehensive dashboard for hotel management, including booking, chat, messages, content (carousel, rooms, pricing, amenities) management. This needs user authentication and database persistence for various entities.
So far, the AI chatbot is functional with AI, multi-language, and memory. Most static and dynamic content pages are built and linked. A full admin dashboard with login, dashboard overview, and navigation is implemented, now integrating with MongoDB for data persistence.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on integrating the newly implemented admin dashboard with the MongoDB database. This involved creating Mongoose models for , , , , and  entities, establishing a MongoDB connection via , and updating the admin login API  to authenticate against the  model. A database seeder  was also created and successfully run via a new API endpoint  to populate initial data. The dashboard API  was updated to fetch real data. The current issue is an Internal Server Error (HTTP 500) encountered during admin login. Server logs () and the engineer's thoughts indicate a module issue or problem with file extensions in imports (, etc.). The engineer's last action was attempting to fix file extensions in imports to resolve this specific module resolution problem.
